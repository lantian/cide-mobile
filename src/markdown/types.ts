/**
 * What a parsed markdown document is, as data. (M20)
 *
 * # Why there is a tree at all, rather than a string of HTML
 *
 * Every markdown renderer in the ecosystem answers `string → HTML string`, and consuming one
 * means `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` plus a sanitizer, which is a dependency pair this project has
 * twice written comments to avoid: `panes/ImagePane.tsx` on why an SVG goes through `<img>` and
 * is never inlined, and `sidebar/TasksPanel/TaskDetail.tsx` on why a comment is `pre-wrap` text
 * and "never as HTML or markdown — it is model-authored, and rendering model-authored markup
 * inside the IDE's own chrome is an injection surface bought for nothing". A `.md` in a cloned
 * repository is exactly as untrusted as either.
 *
 * A tree closes that off structurally rather than by filtering. There is no node here that
 * carries markup, so there is no path from a document to script — not a sanitized one, not one
 * at all. `MarkdownPreview.tsx` maps these nodes to React elements and React escapes text.
 *
 * The second reason is that a tree can be *checked*. `ui/scripts/check-markdown.mjs` compiles
 * this module and its two parsers with the TypeScript in `node_modules` and asserts on the
 * values they produce, which is the only kind of frontend test this repository has. An HTML
 * string would be assertable only by matching substrings of it.
 *
 * Import-free, and deliberately so — see the compile list in `check-markdown.mjs`.

 * It is wrong for a message. `'break'` is the convention every comment box uses — a newline is a
 * line — and it is what `TaskMarkdown.tsx` asks for, because a task comment is written the way a
 * chat message is and read at 620px. The default stays CommonMark; only the caller that knows it
 * is rendering a message opts out.
 *
 * A *hard* break (two trailing spaces, or a trailing backslash) is unaffected either way.
