// cide's remote wire, written by `cargo xtask codegen` from `#[derive(TS)]` types in

// A type that is not reachable from a frame is not on this wire and is not in this file, which
// is what makes reading this file the same thing as reading the protocol.
//
// Notably absent, and structurally so: `Workspace` and everything under it. It carries
// `Settings`, which carries provider API keys and proxy passwords in plaintext. Nothing on this
// wire can name it. See `crates/cide-ipc/src/remote.rs`.
//
// The companion application vendors this file by copy and compares PROTOCOL_VERSION against what
// a server announces in its `welcome` frame. The rules are in `crates/cide-remote`: adding a
// variant or an optional field keeps this number, removing or renaming anything bumps it.
//
// CI runs `cargo xtask codegen --check`, so a Rust rename that never reached this file fails the

 * nothing for a cancel to name.
 *
 * And a run goes on meaning something **after** the child dies: its exit code, the task it
 * was dispatched against, whether its turn was frozen mid-flight. The session registry

 * the one row a user actually wants to read — the one that just failed — with it.

 * a spawn that returned an error. `SessionState` has no vocabulary for any of them, and it

 *
 * In a patch struct, `agent: None` means "not mentioned, leave it alone". Expressing "set it to

 * because `cide://tasks-changed` used to carry every word ever written into a project's tracker
 * — 2.19 MB on a four-month-old board, of which the comments alone were 77.5% — and Tauri

 * holds, because the state itself carries no text and nobody is obliged to add any. A blocked
 * task here is `Todo` with a comment — which is strictly more informative, is a shape an agent
 * can write without being taught a new vocabulary, and is exactly what a failed worktree merge
 * produces (`cide_agent_integrate` comments the conflicting paths and leaves the task where it
 * was).
 *
 * **`Cancelled`.** This file is a working queue, not an archive: a cancelled task is one the
 * user deletes, and `git log -p .cide/tasks.json` already holds the record of it having
 * existed, in more detail than a tombstone row could. A `Cancelled` group would also compete
 * with `Done` for the bottom of the panel, where neither is being read.
 *
 * # The one that was added: `Inbox` (M83)
 *
 * `Inbox` is not `Blocked` under another name. It is not a reason attached to work; it is the
 * statement that something is **not work yet**. Before it existed, "anything noticed in passing
 * goes on the board" meant every defect a run tripped over became a `Todo` — a task autodispatch
 * would start, the spinner counted as open work, and the next planning turn read as part of the
 * plan. Measured on a real board (`~/work/selfcraft`, four months, 232 tasks): of 98 open tasks,
 * 36 were the plan and the rest were things somebody noticed. The board grew faster than it
 * closed, and the orchestrator read the growth as progress.
 *
 * So a thing noticed goes to the inbox, and nothing about the inbox is automatic: autodispatch
 * does not start it (`autodispatch` starts `Todo | Doing` only), the spinner does not count it as
 * open work, and a role assigned to it is not woken. It becomes work by being moved to `Todo` —
 * by the orchestrator when a milestone needs it, or by the user. It never expires: a project left
 * alone for a month has the same inbox when it is opened again, because time passing says nothing
 * about whether an observation was right.
 *
 * It is placed **first** so that the derived `Ord` keeps reading as the life of a task.

 * `Copy` and `Hash` because the panel groups by this and the group order is a lookup table.
